      <h6><strong>Rotating LED Display</strong></h6>
      <p>
        In the last semester of my university i have done a project called rotating LED display and that was project for measurement and control tools. This device indicate a name or number or whatever based on programmers choice.   
        In this project i designed a set of LEDs and pragramed them with an arduino uno microcontroler.
        Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
        The purpose of this project is to use a pattern of turning off and on LEDs while rotating by an AC motor at an specific speeed to demonstrate a meaningful image, word or number.

        At first i used arduino coding programm and downloaded it from its website www.arduino.cc and programmed the arduino uno board.
        For this project i needed an arduino uno electronic board, an AC motor, a battery, 6 resistor, 6 LED,a PCB and wires.
        I brazed resistors and LEDs to PCB with wires. Then connected PCB to my surface that i placed arduino board and battery above it and AC motor under it.

        In programming the Arduino board, sparkling the LEDs depends on how many RPM the AC motor rotates.
        On a specified pattern and a limited speed, it shows a determined image.
        The interesting point was when i wanted to record a video from its working. Because of difference between eye and a camera (because videos conducted by repeated images and those images are shows in a slower pace than human eye) it wasn't shown as clear as human eye.
        At the battery provide power for arduino board and for AC motor which was launched with a switch key for turning on and off.
